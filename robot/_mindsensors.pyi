        An instance of this object represents a single CANLight device. Multiple
        devices can be used indepentently to control multiple light strips. Only a
        single instance can be created for each device ID. Please construct this
        object only once when initializing your robot and pass the reference around.
        If you do wish to call this constructor with the same ID later, call the
        destructor first.
        
        If a CANLight does not have a CAN connection to a roboRIO, its default
        behavior of :meth:`.Cycle` will be used. If it
        does find a CAN connection, it will execute {@link #ShowRegister(int)
        ShowRegister(0)}. The CANLight will continue to execute its last command
        until a new one is issued via one of the methods detailed below.
        
        The CANLight can hold a sequence of up to eight colors and associated
        durations. Each register has a default value. The WriteRegister command can
        be used to change these. The CANLight will restore its default values when
        power is lost.
